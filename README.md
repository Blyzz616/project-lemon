# Project Lemon

I've always wanted a lemon tree.

- Problem1: Canada - Winter is coming (there will be snow).
- Problem2: I'm not going to be living at my current house forever.
- Problem3: I'm a black thumb. 

Solutiuon1:
You get indoor Lemon Trees! What?

Solution2:
An indoor tree means that it's in a pot. It doesn't need to be planted in the ground. It can move when I do.

Solution3:
Enter `Project Lemon`

Intended solution:

1: Use a moisture sensor to measure the lemon tree's hydration levels.
2: Output values to Discord 

Why discord?
I don't have a small screen to display moisture. I **do** have a discord server.

Harware:
- Capacative Moisture Sensor
- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
- Esp32-C6
